        <h2>Tips for Accurate Recording</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to account for all your time - even short activities</li>
            <li>If you did multiple things at once, record the main activity first</li>
            <li>Be as specific as possible when choosing activities</li>
            <li>If you can't find an exact match, use "other" and type in your activity</li>
            <li>Make sure activities don't overlap unless intended</li>
        </ul>
